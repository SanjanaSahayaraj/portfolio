                  Sanjana and I worked together as a two-person team on a research project concerning the merging of data from medical ontologies, and deriving a new kind of word embedding for terms in the ontologies. We worked together on conceptual aspects, on programming, on devising and performing performance tests, and on writing a conference submission describing our work. Throughout I was impressed by Sanjana's initiative, skills, creativity, and teamwork. Her work on combining ontologies using ontology keyword queries as a first step, facility with Python and Github, and writing the majority of the submission manuscript were particularly important. I was also impressed by Sanjana's presentations and contributions to discussions, for a journal club we were both in, studying neural nets for NLP. Sanjana also took initiative in organizing events and activities that helped our larger organization at IBM, before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. This played an important role in keeping our group coherent and sane. It was a pleasure to work with Sanjana, I strongly recommend her.

                  Sanjana worked on my team as a Software Engineering Researcher at IBM Almaden. I have found Sanjana to have a very strong work ethic which is something I value above everything else. Sanjana is smart, sharp, quick learner and very professional. She works well with people, eager to take on hard problems, follows-through on issues and resolves them. She can multi-task very well and I have seen her juggle many projects and problems while on my team. She is a pleasure to work with. She is moving to another role as a Data Scientist in IBM India. I wish her the very best in all her future endeavors and hope our paths cross again. She will do well in any team she joins and they are lucky to have her. Best Wishes Sanjana!!!

                  I was Sanjana’s mentor when she worked at IBM Almaden Research Center. We have regular lunch mentoring sessions which we usually discuss career planning, tips to help her grow internal and external eminence, etc. She always prepared for each session with well-thought and articulated questions. I really enjoyed the opportunity to interact with such a young, energetic and dedicated research software engineer. I was always inspired by her capability to connect with members across teams and organizations, her enthusiasm to share her expertise in NLP and help others in many ways. I hope she will enjoy her next step of career in India. I highly recommend her!

                  Sanjana and I were part of the same team which was focussed on delivering novel health informatics solutions to the Watson Health Imaging business unit at IBM. We worked very closely to come up with a solution to adapt an existing product to work on EMR in French. 
    Right from the get-go, I realized that Sanjana was a fast learner. She asked the right questions and if something wasn't clear she made sure she had the information that she needed. Her documentation skills, which is something I value very much in a researcher, is second to none. She was on top of her deadlines as well. She is an excellent team player as well and was always there if I needed help or needed to clarify something with her. 
    She will be a valuable asset no matter where she goes. It was real pleasure to work with her.

                  Sanjana and I worked in the same group and collaborated on a project involving crowdsourcing and Semantic Role Labeling. Her knowledge of NLP and top software engineering skills became apparent during this collaboration. She is eager to share her knowledge. I mentored Sanjana on patenting at IBM and its process. She was a quick learner and went on to officially become an inventor by filing her first patent. She is curious, engaged and creative so I expect her to remain active as an inventor. In addition, Sanjana invests time and effort participating and leading activities that promote community building, team spirit and technical exchanges. I highly recommend her.
