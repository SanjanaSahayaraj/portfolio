              I finished my undergrad in Science and Engineering in India and Master of Science in the USA, which laid my technical foundations in Computer Science and Machine Learning. I started working full time as an NLP Research Engineer in the USA, before returning to India through the same company (IBM). During this time, I also enrolled in an executive MBA programme, to gain and apply business sense alongside the application of technical skills to solve business problems. And continued my career progression in India, in the Data Science and ML space.

              Sanjana and I worked together as a two-person team on a research project concerning the merging of data from medical ontologies, and deriving a new kind of word embedding for terms in the ontologies. We worked together on conceptual aspects, on programming, on devising and performing performance tests, and on writing a conference submission describing our work. Throughout I was impressed by Sanjana's initiative, skills, creativity, and teamwork. Her work on combining ontologies using ontology keyword queries as a first step, facility with Python and Github, and writing the majority of the submission manuscript were particularly important. I was also impressed by Sanjana's presentations and contributions to discussions, for a journal club we were both in, studying neural nets for NLP. Sanjana also took initiative in organizing events and activities that helped our larger organization at IBM, before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. This played an important role in keeping our group coherent and sane. It was a pleasure to work with Sanjana, I strongly recommend her.

              Sanjana worked on my team as a Software Engineering Researcher at IBM Almaden. I have found Sanjana to have a very strong work ethic which is something I value above everything else. Sanjana is smart, sharp, quick learner and very professional. She works well with people, eager to take on hard problems, follows-through on issues and resolves them. She can multi-task very well and I have seen her juggle many projects and problems while on my team. She is a pleasure to work with. She is moving to another role as a Data Scientist in IBM India. I wish her the very best in all her future endeavors and hope our paths cross again. She will do well in any team she joins and they are lucky to have her. Best Wishes Sanjana!!!

              I was Sanjana’s mentor when she worked at IBM Almaden Research Center. We have regular lunch mentoring sessions which we usually discuss career planning, tips to help her grow internal and external eminence, etc. She always prepared for each session with well-thought and articulated questions. I really enjoyed the opportunity to interact with such a young, energetic and dedicated research software engineer. I was always inspired by her capability to connect with members across teams and organizations, her enthusiasm to share her expertise in NLP and help others in many ways. I hope she will enjoy her next step of career in India. I highly recommend her!

              Sanjana is amazing at what she does especially in the domain of NLU. She has contributed to the NLU-related problem statement at Fi. Her solutions are directly integrated into the product, creating a better user experience for our users. She's a very quick learner and implements solutions efficiently which was evident by how she learned graph-based modeling and used it in building the solution.

From a cultural perspective, she is an amazing fit for our team. She takes a ton of initiatives to improve the existing process, share feedback, and mentor those around her. She's always available for helping and brainstorming problem statements.

              Sanjana is a great collaborator, innovator, and technical guru. I worked with her on a Data Science team at IBM creating solutions in cloud computing management. Sanjana not only has a deep technical knowledge but also the unique talent of understanding and being able to push product vision. I was continually impressed by her elegant solutions and knowledge of new technologies and academic research. Sanjana was the biggest driver of innovation in our team. She mentored us in patent writing and encouraged team members to explore many invention ideas. Sanjana is an excellent team member and exceptional Data Scientist, and I would be happy to work with her anytime.

              Sanjana and I were part of the same team which was focussed on delivering novel health informatics solutions to the Watson Health Imaging business unit at IBM. We worked very closely to come up with a solution to adapt an existing product to work on EMR in French. 
Right from the get-go, I realized that Sanjana was a fast learner. She asked the right questions and if something wasn't clear she made sure she had the information that she needed. Her documentation skills, which is something I value very much in a researcher, is second to none. She was on top of her deadlines as well. She is an excellent team player as well and was always there if I needed help or needed to clarify something with her. 
She will be a valuable asset no matter where she goes. It was real pleasure to work with her.

Her knowledge of NLP and top software engineering skills became apparent during this collaboration. She is eager to share her knowledge. I mentored Sanjana on patenting at IBM and its process. She was a quick learner and went on to officially become an inventor by filing her first patent. She is curious, engaged and creative so I expect her to remain active as an inventor. In addition, Sanjana invests time and effort participating and leading activities that promote community building, team spirit and technical exchanges. I highly recommend her.

              Sanjana is a highly dedicated and proficient senior data scientist. She is a very quick learner and well versed in model development for supporting diverse features in multi-cloud management platform. Her application of model building skills is unique and she has researched and built high performing cost optimization models that works well in production. In addition, she is a solid contributor of patents and is a role model for others in the team to pursue. Only with her guidance and support could I submit my first invention work. Being a high end team player she stands out and plays a major role in case of any presentations and infonaut sessions to wider and delivery teams. She always proved to be a super enthusiastic person with ability to pick up any task and deliver with high quality and on time. One such example is her contribution in the MLOPS work including model customization, model serving and monitoring. Data Science being a fast growing and demanding industry sector, I am confident that person like Sanjana will be able to satisfy the needs with her strategic decision-making and technology skills and foster the growth of the project and the organization
